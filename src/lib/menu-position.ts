/**
 * Keep a floating context menu inside the visible viewport.
 *
 * Context menus open at the pointer's client coordinates. When the pointer is
 * near the right or bottom edge — routine once the sidebar holds enough
 * channels or DM conversations to fill its height — the menu extends past the
 * viewport and its lower / right items are clipped or unreachable.
 *
 * Used as a ref callback on the menu element. It measures the menu on the next
 * frame (after its items are laid out and it has its real size) and nudges it
 * back inside: flipped above / left of the anchor point when there is no room
 * below / to the right, and clamped to a small margin from every edge. If the
 * menu is taller than the viewport it is pinned to the top margin and left to
 * scroll (`overflow-y: auto` in the menu CSS).
 *
 *   <div ref={keepMenuInViewport} style={{ left: `${x}px`, top: `${y}px` }} />
