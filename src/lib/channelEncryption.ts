/**
 * Whether a channel's media/content must be treated as encrypted, extracted
 * as a pure function so this security-critical decision is independently
 * testable (see channelEncryption.test.mjs).
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED (2026-08-02): a confidentiality decision must never default to
 * "plaintext" just because the channel record hasn't resolved yet. The bug
 * this fixes — `isEncrypted()` reading `channelInfo()?.channel?.X` directly —
 * returned `false` (plaintext) while `channelInfo` was still loading (initial
 * mount, or a transient `createResource` refetch that briefly clears the
 * resolved value), so an image attached in that window uploaded to IPFS
 * unencrypted even in a private/encrypted channel. Unless the channel record
 * has SUCCESSFULLY resolved (`state === 'ready'`) to a definite plaintext
 * signal, this returns `true`.
