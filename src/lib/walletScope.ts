/**
 * Per-wallet namespacing for locally cached account state.
 *
 * The project rule is that ALL data is indexed under the wallet address. The
 * vault and E2E layers already honour it; the profile/preference layer did not
 * — topic groups, channel organisation, joined channels, hidden DMs, mutes and
 * news read positions all lived under GLOBAL localStorage keys. Disconnecting
 * one wallet and connecting another therefore left the previous account's
 * lists on screen: confusing, and a privacy leak between accounts on a shared
 * browser.
 *
 * Keys resolved through here become `<base>::<address>`, so two accounts never
 * collide and reconnecting restores what that account had.
 *
 * DEVICE-level settings (language, theme, node URL, font size, sidebar width…)
 * deliberately do NOT go through here: they belong to the browser profile, not
 * to the account.
 *
 * The web client is single-account by design — there is no account switcher —
 * but a browser still hosts several wallets over time, sequentially: a
 * disconnect followed by a different wallet, or the Klever extension switching
 * accounts underneath us. That is the same situation, and it needs the same
 * namespacing.
 *
 * Ported from the mobile implementation (mobile/src/lib/walletScope.ts), which
 * is the reference for this pattern. localStorage is synchronous, so the reads
 * and writes here are too.
